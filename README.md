# PagingUICollectionViewTesting
An exploration of a UICollectionView whose pages are smaller than the
collection view bounds.

This is intended to be merged with [Project Prox][Prox], to replace the
PlaceDetailViewController. If left incomplete, this is intended to allow others
to learn about these techniques. This could also be useful as a blog post,
though there is [prior
art](http://blog.karmadust.com/centered-paging-with-preview-cells-on-uicollectionview/).

See additional explanation in
[`ViewController`](https://github.com/mcomella/PagingUICollectionViewTesting/blob/master/CollectionViewTesting/ViewController.swift).

## Running

```sh
open CollectionViewTesting.xcworkspace
```

And build/run in xcode.
